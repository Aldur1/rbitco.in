<h1>Real Bitcoin (rbitco.in)</h1>
<h3>This portal is being discontinued from 31st January 2014. Since 9th January 2013, we were sharing bitcoin information for Indian customers. We also had international customer registration from different countries. All users who registered with their email, were verified. Some users had deposited bitcoins from sites offering them, and also withdraw bitcoins. We have still users who have their BTC with us.</h3>
<h3>We would like to return all the coins to all the users who have a balance still deposited with us. We will be sending an email to all the users before 15th January 2014, with specific instructions to receive their deposits to rbitco.in.</h3>
<h3>Please make sure you follow the instructions and restore the coins in your personal wallet using the private keys. Your wallet can be a desktop client or any other web hosted client.</h3>
<h3>Next month we will be continuing the service with a fresh data and a new site!</h3>
