<h2>Your security is important to us</h2>
<p>Security is an important part of operating any payments company, and something we take seriously.  Here are some of security precautions we have in place:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>All the customer funds are stored offline (disconnected from the internet)</li>
	<li>Out servers are located in highly secure network in LA, USA.</li>
    <li>Passwords are stored in the database using hash</li>
    <li>We offer 3-factor authentication on your account. Email, phone and physical verification.</li>
    <li>The site runs over ssl (https) and session cookies are marked secure</li>
    <li>We rate limit a variety of actions (login attempts, etc)</li>
    <li>We whitelist attributes on all models to prevent mass-assignment vulnerabilities</li>
    <li>We use Lithium which inherits SQL injection filters</li>
    <li>We only use the authenticity of POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to prevent CSRF attacks</li>
    <li>We only use strong passwords on account creation and password reset</li>
    <li>Credentials are highly encrypted and never available to the programmer or DB admin</li>
    <li>We use password managers to keep separate passwords for each service</li>
    <li>All your private keys are encrypted stored in the database.</li>
    <li>Employees do not have access to the DB, they utilize strong passwords, and enable screen locking</li>
</ul>
<!--
In the future, we plan to add some or all of the following before moving out of Beta:

    Moving servers to locked cages
    Encrypting the entire database or drive on servers
    Offering a guarantee or insurance against loss
    Background checks on employees
    Quarterly security audits by outsides firms, and disaster drills
