Yes. This is the method we recommend most if you're inside the USA...

    This is the fastest method. No waiting for funds to clear - cash is cash.
    This is also the most anonymous method. You don't need a bank account of your own. The teller won't even ask your name. You're just making a cash deposit... 

You can just walk in to the nearest branch of...

    Bank of America ( branch locator )
    Chase Bank ( branch locator )
    Citibank ( branch locator ) 

Simply walk in to any branch of whichever of these banks is most convenient for you... anywhere in the USA. Grab a blank Checking Account Deposit Ticket. Fill it in with the Name and Account Number that we provide for you ( on the Shopping Cart Checkout page ). Hand that deposit ticket to the human teller along with the green paper cash in the amount of your order. The teller will then give you a deposit receipt. Save that receipt. Simply, write your Invoice/Order Number on that paper receipt, then take a photo of the receipt with your camera phone ( being sure to get all four edges in the photo ). Then email it to us at: email@buybitcoin.com along with your Invoice/Order Number in the subject line of the email.

How will we know it's you who made the deposit?

Please round the dollar amount of your order up to the next higher whole dollar amount, then add the last two digits of the Invoice/Order Number to the amount, as cents. This unique deposit amount is how we can tell it was you who made the deposit.

In other words, for example...

    If your order total is: $832.32 Round it up to: $833.00
    Then, if your Invoice/Order Number is: BB-10073
    Add $0.73 to the amount... ( the last two digits of your Order Number is 73 )
    Making the final exact amount to deposit: $833.73
